# About Spellshock

## What is spellshock?
Spellshock is Balatro inspired (currently)text game where you're a wizard going through dungeon trying to reach floor 10. 
basic game loop involves being given a randon "hand" of affinities, which you choose and combine to cast spells to defeat monsters. 
Everytime you cast a spell, get stronger using that spell and affinity. Spells get stronger the more of the same affinity you use, and using one of each affinity grants a special spell. 
As you venture deeper înto the dungeon, enemies will get harder and harder, and you wil meet "Floor Guardians" at the end of each, al1 the way to level 10 to reach the last guardian. 
Through careful affinity selection, spell casting, and luck of the draw, you eventually meet your last denizen, who may be stronger than you think...
Floor 10 is the last floor of the game and i contain the ending depending on the outcome.

## Extras
While I was not able to fully impliment Pygame visuals in the alloted time, I still surpassed my minimum goal by making sure to add extra features to Spellshock, and I will also list off other do items I would love to add in the future, should I continue to develop Spellshock.
Spellshock features an affinity scaling and redrawing system. 
Spellshock also features 10 floors with 5 levels each, every Floor Guardian has a random name, race, and occupation, from threatning to silly. 
Spellshock has multiple endings, although you aren't exactly supposed to "win", I still included an ending if you do beat the guardian waiting on the final floor. 
Spellshock also has round and floor scaling which gets progressively harder and forces you to be more selective with which spells and affinities you choose. 

##  Things I would love to add: 
Firstly, I believe visuals would go great, it is unfortunate I wasnt able to add them. 
I have many ideas for a "trinket" system in which you can find and/or buy trinkets at shops between floors which can increase the power of certain spells and affinities. With these, scaling would becone more harsh to keep the game riveting and challenging. 
The trinkets could also increase your health, give special effects other than damage boosts when you cast specific spells/affinities, and more. 
More names, racesz and occupations would help keep the game fresh.
I would also like to try to add a character select, where some characters could have more health at the cost of less affinity redrawing or vice versa.

Overall, this is Spellshock, my final project for ANIGH 2305 Programing for Digital Arts
